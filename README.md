It will predict the value from one dependent variable to independent variable

In this code , I have taken area and price for buying a house, as machine it will predict the prices based on the area of the house/land.
here, area is independent and price is dependent.

i.e area=x-axis, price=y-axis.

formula: price(y)=m*area+c , here m is slope/coef and c is intercept
